<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<p>At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:</p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>At least four different sorting algorithms<br>
1. What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm<br>
2. How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input<br>
3. What is a stable sorting algorithm</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p> The project implements sorting in place in order to ensure that space complexity is roughly constant. We have implemented the algorithms on:<br>
1. Arrays<br>
2. Doubly linked lists</p>
